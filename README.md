This is an archive of my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Running these solutions

`./bin/advent-of-code.js day <number>`

## Development

All commits should be done using the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format. This format is validated in CI and will block pull requests.

To prevent this happening, you can enable the pre commit message linting backed by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) powered git hooks. This is enabled by running `npm run prepare`
